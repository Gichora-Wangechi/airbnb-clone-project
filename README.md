## 2. Team Roles and Responsibilities

**Business Analyst**
Responsible for gathering, analyzing, and documenting business requirements. Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team to ensure the product meets business goals.

**Product Owner**
Defines the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and ensures the development team delivers value to the customer. Represents the voice of the user throughout the development process.

**Project Manager**
Plans, coordinates, and monitors project progress. Ensures timelines, budgets, and resources are aligned with project goals and communicates status updates to stakeholders.

**UI/UX Designer**
Designs intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces and experiences. Conducts user research, prototypes designs, and collaborates with developers to implement design solutions.

**Software Architect**
Designs the system's overall structure, defines technical standards, and makes high-level design decisions to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

**Software Developer**
Implements application features based on technical specifications. Writes clean, efficient, and testable code while collaborating closely with other developers and stakeholders.

**Quality Assurance (QA)**
Ensures that the product meets quality standards through manual testing. Identifies bugs, validates functionality, and helps improve the overall product stability.

**Test Automation Engineer**
Creates automated test scripts to validate application functionality quickly and reliably. Works closely with QA and developers to maintain a robust automated testing pipeline.

**DevOps Engineer**
Manages deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and system reliability. Ensures continuous integration and deployment processes run smoothly and securely.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API  
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs  
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage  
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data  
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments  
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management  
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes  

## 4. Database Design Overview

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management  
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval  
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details  
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details  
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties  
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations  

## 5. Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile management  
- **Property Management**: Listing creation, updates, and retrieval  
- **Booking System**: Reserve properties and manage bookings  
- **Payment Processing**: Handle transactions and record payment history  
- **Review System**: Users can rate and review properties

## 6. API Security Overview

**Objective**: To understand the importance of securing backend APIs and outline the security measures used.

### Key Security Measures:

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only verified users can access the system.  
  *Importance*: Prevents unauthorized access and identity spoofing.

- **Authorization**: Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do.  
  *Importance*: Protects sensitive operations and data by enforcing role-based access.

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricts the number of requests a client can make in a given time frame.  
  *Importance*: Helps prevent abuse such as DDoS attacks or brute-force login attempts.

### Why Security is Crucial:
- Protects user data and privacy  
- Ensures system reliability and trustworthiness  
- Prevents malicious exploitation of resources

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes as they are pushed to the repository.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automates the release of code to production or staging environments after it passes the testing pipeline.

### Benefits:
- Faster development and delivery cycles  
- Early detection of bugs and integration issues  
- Reliable and repeatable deployment processes  
- Reduces manual errors

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment workflows  
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application in consistent environments  
- **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** containers: Used during integration testing  
- **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**: For hosting and deployment environments
