## 5. API Security Overview

**Objective**: To understand the importance of securing backend APIs and outline the security measures used.

### Key Security Measures:

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only verified users can access the system.  
  *Importance*: Prevents unauthorized access and identity spoofing.

- **Authorization**: Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do.  
  *Importance*: Protects sensitive operations and data by enforcing role-based access.

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricts the number of requests a client can make in a given time frame.  
  *Importance*: Helps prevent abuse such as DDoS attacks or brute-force login attempts.

### Why Security is Crucial:
- Protects user data and privacy  
- Ensures system reliability and trustworthiness  
- Prevents malicious exploitation of resources

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes as they are pushed to the repository.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automates the release of code to production or staging environments after it passes the testing pipeline.

### Benefits:
- Faster development and delivery cycles  
- Early detection of bugs and integration issues  
- Reliable and repeatable deployment processes  
- Reduces manual errors

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment workflows  
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application in consistent environments  
- **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** containers: Used during integration testing  
- **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**: For hosting and deployment environments
